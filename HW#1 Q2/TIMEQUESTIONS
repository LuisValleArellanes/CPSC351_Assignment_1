QUESTION ANSWERS FOR PART II 

1. In the output of time, what is the difference betweenreal,user, andsystimes?
  - real: uses wall clock time from when the process starts to when it finishes 
  - user: the amount of time the cpu spends in user mode while running the process 
  - sys: the amount of time the cpu spends in the kernel within the process 
  
2. Which is longer user time or sys time? Use your knowledge to explain why.
  - User time is generally longer bc when a process is running the cpu is mainly in usermode and ony switches to sys mode when the process invokes 
    an instruction that only the OS can accomplish 
    
3. When fetching all of the locations in the file, which fetcher finishes faster? Why do you think that is?
  - Serial took longer because the parent had to wait for each individual child to finish before moving to the next, while the parralel parent process
    let the children work all at once, then waited for all of them at once to finish 
    
4. Suppose one of the fetcher children crashes. Will this affect other children? Explain.What is your conclusion regarding 
    the benefits or disadvantages of isolating each fetchtask within a different process?
  - (looking at our program) if a child crashes it will affect the other children as they will become orphans, In our Parallel program the parent 
  uses a while loop to wait for the children and uses the condition "wait(NULL) > 0", if a child crashes the wait function will return a -1 causing 
  the while loop to exit. If there are still children active while this happens the parent process will terminate without them and thus creating orphans. 
  This is where the serial program strives as since the parent waits for each child before moving to the next, if one crashes it will simply return a -1
  and then loop again moving onto the next child, avoiding any chances of orphans.
